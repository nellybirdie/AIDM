"` For the purpose of this statistical analysis, starting from 15 September 2022, the statistics cover population ever vaccinated in HK (the individuals may also have doses taken outside HK).  Vaccine dose(s) taken outside HK by these individuals have been taken into account in the analysis of the number of doses taken.  As compared to the statistics reported on 14 September, the aforementioned technical refinements result in a reduction of 200,000 persons.",,,,,,,,,,,
^ Age is calculated based on the date of first vaccine dose. ,,,,,,,,,,,
~ Toddlers aged from six months to three years may receive the COVID-19 vaccine in Hong Kong starting from 4 August 2022. ,,,,,,,,,,,
# Including those that have received 1 dose but not yet reached 14 days.,,,,,,,,,,,
* Estimated unvaccinated population is derived by the difference between the end-2021 resident population (provisional figure) and the population ever vaccinated in Hong Kong/elsewhere.,,,,,,,,,,,
"@ Apart from Hong Kong residents, eligible persons under the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme also include the following categories of non-Hong Kong residents: ",,,,,,,,,,,
   (1) holders of the Exit-entry Permit for Travelling to and from Hong Kong and Macao who can complete two doses of vaccination within their limit of stay without extension; ,,,,,,,,,,,
   (2) non-refoulement claimants and refugees recognised by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; and ,,,,,,,,,,,
"   (3) other visitors staying in Hong Kong (holders of valid travel documents who are allowed to stay in Hong Kong as permitted by the law, and can complete two doses of vaccination within their limit of stay without extension). ",,,,,,,,,,,
"   These non-Hong Kong residents who are eligible to receive vaccination may not be included in the baseline population eligible to receive vaccination.  Therefore, the population ever vaccinated in Hong Kong/elsewhere may be greater than the Hong Kong resident population.  ",,,,,,,,,,,
"   Separately, the relevant baseline population is not based on real time figures and there may be deviations from the actual situation.  As a result, the estimated unvaccinated population may be a negative number and thus not shown in the report.",,,,,,,,,,,
