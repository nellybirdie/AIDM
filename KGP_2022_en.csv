The EYFS curriculum follows the principles with which Montessorians are very familiar with and have been advocating for over a hundred years: that the child is unique; that positive relationship form the basis for personal respect supporting learning; that the learning environment has a key role in extending learning and development, and that children learn and develop in different ways and at different pace.","The school strongly believes that each child's learning is intrinsically linked with child development and that it is not possible for a child to learn until they are ready. This readiness vary from child to child. The learning and development approach takes into account the fact that children develop and learn in different ways and at different rates and that ALL areas of learning and development are interconnected and are equally important in contributing to a child's development. The environment plays a very significant part in our school. There are six clearly defined areas in the classroom. Each of these areas have Montessori's original designs and activities made and prepared by the Montessori directness to help each child develop skills and learn concepts. These activities are easily accessible to the children, promoting repetition and practise of targeted skill which each material is designed for. Outdoor activities are also done on a regular basis.","Our school provide learning opportunities for mixed age groups of children. Emphasis is placed on children learning spontaneously by independently selecting activities appropriate for their learning and stage of development. Observation and evaluation are carried out on a daily basis. Assessment results are observed, tested and recorded through the various activities and materials used by each child. Observations are recorded on the children's individual learning plan (Individual record of Achievement). Observations are analysed and serve as a basis for future planning for individual children as stated above. ","Montessori holds that the most vital role of infancy and the very first period of a child's life is that of adaptation. It is this that provides a child with the ability to adapt to his environment, whatever the condition when he entered it"". For this Montessori claims""... that the ontogenesis of man is an adaptive one; to construct a model of behaviour which renders him free to act in the world about him, and to influence it"" (Montessori (1949), page 60).

We believe that every child is capable, competent and creative and our Early Years programme promotes independence and natural curiosity. We know that learning happens best in the early years through play, exploration and inquiry. Our  Pre-Kindergarten classrooms offer environments that are interactive, safe and fun for every child. Our teachers have developed a play-based curriculum that inspires curiosity, collaboration and enthusiasm. This is complemented by our specialist teachers who provide rich, engaging opportunities for our youngest learners to express themselves through language, literacy,  movement, art, music and numbers. The Early Years learning environment is sensory-rich and visually appealing, inviting children to take the lead and drive their own exploration through the use of a range of materials.","The early years are the first building blocks of a child’s learning journey. Teachers use the PYP transdisciplinary themes to create units of inquiry that weave together knowledge, skills and understandings from different subject areas. Through the PYP, students become more aware of themselves and the world around them, identifying how they can make contributions in meaningful and developmentally-appropriate ways.   We also recognise the important role of these first few years as a stepping stone to future learning and our programme provides a solid foundation for learners that is cognitively challenging and emotionally nurturing. Each child is empowered to understand themselves and others and feel confident about their potential as a learner.  ","HKA defines student assessment as the gathering and analysis of information about student performance in order to identify what students know, understand, can do, and feel at the different stages in the learning process. The assessment process is geared towards developing a student’s critical thinking and self-evaluation skills. Students and teachers engage jointly in assessing student progress, which then is shared at the end of each term through the presentation of student work. Parents are an integral part of this process as they encourage their child’s growth and ability to reflect on their learning.","Hong Kong Academy is a joyful, dynamic learning community that provides a rigorous international education characterised by mutual benefit and support.

It ranges from quietly and attentively listening to a story in the Parent & Child class to participating in a magic wood walk during circle time for the kindergarten.  There are moments during the day where children apply deep focus and concentration, or ‘breathing in’. Those moments are balanced by ‘breathing out’ in activities like open-ended play, games, and artistic activities like handwork, woodwork, drawing, and painting.

Through interactive experiences with nature and contribution to our community a sense of interconnectedness and global citizenship is fostered.

The materials in our classrooms have been carefully selected to engage interest and cultivate mastery in these subjects.  Crucially, Maria Montessori emphasised the importance of mixed-age grouping as a tool for social development and peer-led learning.

Children in K2 and K3 have their own accounts to practice phonics online while teachers monitor their progress.

Children learn about numbers, sorting, counting, shapes and weight and later on some recording of data will be done as well as simple mathematical operations. Understanding the world is approached with a broad offering of experiences and exposure to help children understand how their physical world works. They learn about their community and look at and try out technologies that support people in their daily lives. Expressive arts and design includes exploration of a wide variety of media such as music and movement to inspire new ways of making and moving to music. Individual expression is addressed by using new and recycled materials for arts and crafts. ",Children’s progression is monitored by observations when the child is at work and play.

During the process of teaching and learning, we provide children with opportunities for self-assessment, so that they can constantly reflect on their own learning and therefore take responsibility for their learning. ","We are committed to enabling our children to be confident, open-minded, lifelong learners. Learning engagements are child-centered, incorporating voice, choice and agency. Children learn through effective use of a stimulating environment, quality educational resources and technology. Through inquiry-based activities, children communicate, create and apply thinking skills, in order to acquire a wide range of knowledge, skills and understanding. We encourage children to make connections, engage in shared thinking and take meaningful action.  Our curriculum allows children to explore concepts and reflect on different cultures and perspectives-equipping them with tools to become caring citizens respecting themselves and others. ","At the start of the school year, we will establish an adaptive programme to allow our children to adapt to school life.

In addition, EIS incorporates our own seven attributes into our teaching and evaluations, which we feel are key characteristics to foster in early years children.
